So if each model trains for the maximum of 2,000 epochs I would end up with 12 * 2,000 = 24,000 models to choose from.

Alternatively I could train all models to convergence and then add regularization to reduce the complexity and identify the sweet spot, but that's far more time consuming because it requires training more models and each of them for longer."
